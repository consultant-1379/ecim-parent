Installation Workaround for ET 2.0.3

Two problems have been discovered in the DX 2.5 PRA release which prevents a smooth installation of ET 2.0.3:

* The default RSA 8.0.4 product lacks a couple of features that ET needs.
* The DX ET Update Site cannot be used to install third-party dependencies (ATL and MMA).

We are very sorry for any inconvenience and we hope to fix these problems as soon as possible. Until then, here is a workaround:

1) Start IBM Installation Manager. 

2) Install the RSA 8.0.4 and make sure to include the "Architect - Standard" and the "Eclipse technology extensibility" options. If you have already installed RSA 8.0.4, you can add this feature by modifying your current installation.

3) Start the RSA 8.0.4.

4) Configure RSA Network Connections as described in chapter 2.2 in the ET Installation Instructions.

5) Install the M2M ATL SDK 3.1.1 feature, which is found on update site "http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/m2m/updates/site.xml". (Follow the menus "Help->Install new software...->Add...".)

6) Download and unzip the MetaModelAgent_3.4.1_001.zip file from File Releases on the DX Eforge site (https://eforge.ericsson.se/sf/frs/do/viewRelease/projects.dx/frs.et.dx_2_5_et_2_0_x?_message=1324399595919).

7) Install the MetaModelAgent feature by creating a local archive pointing to where the MMA file was unzipped. (Follow the menus "Help->Install new software...->Add...->Local...".) Make sure to uncheck "Group items by category" option.

8) Restart the RSA.

9) Install the ET 2.0.3 features as described in chapter 3.1 in the ET Installation Instructions. (Basically add update site "http://eecs.rnd.ki.sw.ericsson.se/customer/dx/et/" and select all features in the "DX ECIM Tool-chain latest Release for RSA 8" category.)

10) Restart the RSA.

Now you should have the ET 2.0.3 release correctly installed.
