		description "This JavacafInstSpecAppmngmt MO is used to enable, or disable, the Instance Specific Application Management (ISAM). When
enabled, this feature allows for testing of altered attribute values on a single node before setting them globally in the
cluster. If no instance of this of this class is present in the model, ISAM will be DISABLED.
Ensure that the instruction are read and understood, before using ISAM.
When ISAM is enabled, create a local test object by inserting a LocalTest:INSTANCENAME:OBJECTNAME in the original DN.
If the test of the new value(s) was successful, delete the local test object and set the new values on the original object, in one operation.
If the test was unsuccessful, delete the local test object without setting the new values on the original object.

Note!
- Never turn this feature on or off while local test objects are present in the MOM.
- Never create a local test object without a corresponding global object already present in the MOM
- Never delete a global object while a local test object is still present in the model

An example scenario:
1. An object, ConfigClass=a,App=X,Me=1, is present in the MOM. It holds the attributes timeout and sleep. The attribute timeout is set to 4000 and the attribute sleep is set to 100.
2. The operator needs change to a new timeout value, but it is considered too risky to set it directly on the whole cluster.
3. The operator chooses the instance named AppServer2 as a test server.
4. The operator creates a local test object, ConfigClass=LocalTest:AppServer2:a,App=X,Me=1 with the attribute timeout set to 1000. The operator does not set the attribute sleep in the local test object.
5. The application running on AppServer2 notices that the attribute timeout of object ConfigClass=a,App=X,Me=1 is changed to 1000. Applications on other server instances are unaffected.
6. The operator considers that the new value of the attribute timeout works better, and that the test is successful.
7. The operator changes the attribute timeout to 1000 on ConfigClass=a,App=X,Me=1 and removes the local test object in ONE SINGLE OPERATION.
8. The new value is now set globally.";
